# House_Price_Estimation
Estimating the price of a house Regression Model

This project is a Housing price estimation model, using linear regression model and data from Kaggle. I uploaded the data on my JupyterLab which was then cleaned and thouroughly examined before splitting the data into test and training sets. I then made four data visualizations, one with a correlation matrix. I then checked for all necessary libraries and separated independent and dependent variables and divided data into training and test sets. I moved to performing standardization and then fitting the model to my training data and made predictions using my test data. Lastly I calculated the model performance for test set and exported the model as the pickle to create a website using pythonanywhere where users can predict the price of the house.
